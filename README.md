# Mobile-Robotics
This is the Mobile Robtics project I did in my final year in 2021. Over time I will update it...

1. Operating system used for Linux on a virtual machine (VM) and the Rosbot installation software was installed on this.
2. Programming was carried out inside this VM as well as testing
3. The Rosbot did avoid ostabcles, although speed was a bit slower but this is due to the VM and the system used when it was tested originally.
